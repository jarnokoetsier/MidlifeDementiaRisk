# Machine Learning in EMIF-AD cohort
* `ML_EMIF.R`: Perform machine learning (AD vs control, MCI vs Control) within EMIF-AD cohort using the 14 MRSs as features.
* `ML_EMIF_AdditionalComparisons.R`: Perform machine learning within EMIF-AD cohort (SCI vs Control, MCI vs SCI, AD vs SCI, AD vs MCI) using the 14 MRSs as features.
* `ML_EMIF_CSFBio_AD.R`: AD vs control with CSF biomarkers as additional variables.
* `ML_EMIF_CSFBio_MCI.R`: MCI vs control with CSF biomarkers as additional variables.
* `ML_EMIFCSFBio_SCI.R.R`: SCI vs control with CSF biomarkers as additional variables.
* `ML_PredictCSF_cat.R`: Predict CSF biomarkers (binary) using DNA methylation data.
* `Sensitivity_Specificity_Accuracy.R`: Calculate sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of models.
* `SHAPvalues.R`: Calculate SHAP values of MCI models.
